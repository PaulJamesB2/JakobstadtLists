<h4>Russian Revision Lists</h4>
<p>                 
          Census 
and revision lists were created for the purpose of imposing poll taxes. The census 
lists were introduced by Czar Peter the Great at the beginning of the 18th century. In 
order to keep these records up to date, revisions were made in 10 to 
20 year intervals.&nbsp; In Russia, the first revision was carried out 
from 1718 to 1727. The second revision was conducted from 1743 to 1747, and the 
third took place from 1761 to 1767. For the Baltic states, which were not yet 
subject to Russian administration, these revisions were not done. The fourth 
revision of November 16, 1781, was the first one that was conducted for Livonia 
and Estonia.&nbsp;On June 23, 1794, the Senate ordered another general census 
revision for Livonia and Estonia. This was the fifth revision and was expected 
to be finished by the end of 1796.&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative order of March 30, 1797, 
suggests that the 1794 manifest also applied to the Courland Census, which was 
to be completed by September 13, 1797.&nbsp;&nbsp;Courland did not become a part 
of the Russian Empire until 1795.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the first Courland 
revision was conducted 16 years after the first revision for 
Livonia and Estonia.

<h4>Categorizing Individuals for the 1797 Courland Census</h4>
<p>For the 1797 Courland Census, only house lists were created. Tax register forms 
  were not used, and the house lists did not include tax calculation formulas. 
  This made it impossible to collect taxes. Although the Administration was confused 
  as to the purpose of this census, they decided to classify the individuals into 
  different categories. The following categories were used for the 1797 Parish 
  House Lists:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Aristocracy (Adeligen Standes)</b> - This category applied only to the 
    Knightly Order (Ritterschaft)
  </li></ul><ul>
  <li><b>Professionals (Gelehrten Standes) </b>- This included all the so-called 
    "literary classes" such as pastors, doctors, and teachers, as long 
    as they had recognized credentials</li></ul><ul>
  <li><b>Rural Officials (Beamte auf dem Lande)</b> - This included all the forestry 
    officials and border guards.</li></ul><ul>
  <li><b>Polish and Lithuanian Aristocrats (Schlachtizen) </b>- These were members 
    of the lesser Polish and Lithuanian aristocracy, who were heavily represented 
    in the Duenaburg and Ueberlautz parishes</li></ul><ul>
  <li><b>Free Germans (Freie teutsche Leute)</b> - This included the German residents 
    not included in the first three categories.</li></ul><ul>
  <li><b>Free Latvians (Freie Letten)</b> - Nearly all people in this category 
    had German sounding surnames.</li></ul><ul>
  <li><b>Russians (Russen)</b> - This 
  category&nbsp; mainly consisted of Russian menial 
  laborers, such as ditch diggers, board cutters, and brick makers.</li>          
      </ul><ul>
   <li><b>Free Poles and Lithuanians (Freie Polen und Litauer)</b>  - This covers 
    all citizens of these two nations, except for aristocracy.</li></ul><ul>
  <li><b>Jews (Juden)</b> - All the rural Jews were included here. These may have 
    formed the bulk of the Jewish population, as the migration to the towns occurred 
    later in the Russian era.</li></ul><ul>
  <li><b>Resident Gypsies (Sesshafte Zigeuner)</b> - There are very few entries 
    in this category.</li></ul><ul>
  <li><b>Public Serfs (Publike Erbleute)</b> - This category contains all the 
    indentured peasants of the royal estates, forests, and church properties under 
    the authority of the Crown.</li></ul><ul>
  <li><b>Private Serfs (Private Erbleute)</b> - This covers all indentured servants 
    of the private estates (Knightly estates), civic establishments, and church 
    properties under aristocratic authority.</li></ul><ul>
</ul>
<p>
  The last two categories included approximately 85% of 
Courland's rural population. <BR><BR>Note:&nbsp; The word "Free" in the category 
headings above refers to the fact that the individuals in that category were not 
serfs.<BR><BR>

<h4>The Order of Individuals on the House Lists</h4>
<p>The 1797 House Lists were organized by household. For each household, individuals 
  were listed in the following order:</p>
1. Head of household<br>
<br>
2. Wife<br>
<br>
3. Children (listed by age in descending order)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their spouse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their children<br>
<br>
4. Other relatives living in the house, such as parents, siblings, in-laws, and 
cousins of the head of household <br>
<br>
5. Servants, journeymen, and apprentices<br>
<br>
6. House guests or tenants<br>
<p></p>

<h4>Classifying Properties for the 1797 Courland Census</h4>
<p>The owners or administrators of Parish properties were responsible for the 
  completion of the 1797 Revision Lists for their properties. The properties were 
  classified into the following categories: </p>
<p>1. Royal or knightly estates (Kronsgueter oder Rittergueter)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Leased tenant properties owned by the Crown (buergerliche Lehen)</p>
<p>3. Royal forests with wilderness developments (Kronsforsteien mit Unterforsteien 
  und Wildnisbereitereien)</p>
<p>     4. Church parish&nbsp;properties (Pastorate mit 
  Kuesteraten)</p>
<p> 5.&nbsp;Properties bequeathed to civil administrators (Oberhauptmannswidmen und 
  Hauptmannswidmen)<br>
  <br>

</p>
<h4>1803 Estate Census</h4>
<p>In addition to the 1797 census documents, the 1797 Parish census books also 
  included an 1803 census for many of the estates and villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
  1803 census documents contain house lists for only the serfs from the original 
  1797 census.&nbsp;&nbsp;The free people were no longer counted with the estates 
  in 1803, as they registered with nearby cities for tax purposes in 1798.&nbsp;&nbsp;After 
  1797, house lists for rural free people were included in the City census books.</p>
<P>If an 1803 census was included for an estate, it would appear after the final 
summary and signature page for the 1797 census for that estate.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
1803 census usually included a cover page with an 1803 date.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
standard 1803 house list form differed from the standard 1797 house list 
form.&nbsp;&nbsp;The were six categories for the free people and serfs in the 
column headings&nbsp;on the 1797 census house list form.&nbsp; There were three 
categories for the men and three for the women.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both genders had 
identical categories as follows:</P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Free Born</LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Serfs</LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Serfs who deserted the estate</LI></UL>
<P>The 1803 census had six categories for Serfs only.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 
three categories for the men and three for the women.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both genders 
had identical categories as follows:</P>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Serfs recorded on the 1797 census </li></ul><ul>
<li>
Serfs omitted from the 1797 census 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li >
  Serfs recorded in duplicate entries or recorded with 
  the wrong estate on the 1797 census</li>  </ul>
<P>

<h4>The Census Process</h4>
<p>The originators of the revision lists had to sign them personally and add their 
  official seals.</p>
<p>For each parish (Kirschspiel), revision lists for the individual rural properties 
  were sorted in alphabetical order by parish property name and bound into the parish book. 
  Courland and Pilten were divided into 34 parishes in 1797. These parishes were 
  not church units; they were units of the land administration. These "political 
  parishes" consisted of local groups of Knightly (Ritterschaft) estates owners. 
</p>
<p>A General Parish Statistical Report was generated for each parish, based on 
  the statistics from revision lists for individual properties. There were four 
  districts (Oberhauptmannschaften). In each district, an official assembled a 
  Principal District Statistical Report based on the statistics from its General 
  Parish Statistical Reports. These were handed to the higher authorities, probably 
  the Finance Office (Kameralhof).</p>

<h4>Documents Included in the 1797 Courland House List Census</h4>
<p>Each estate census in the 1797 Courland House List Census includes some or all of the following documents, which appear 
  in the order listed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>1797 Name Index</b>          - 
    The names of heads of households (Wirthe) are 
    listed in alphabetical order on the Name Indices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some indices 
    have separate sections for servant groups (Gesinde) and free people (freie Leute).&nbsp;&nbsp;The number to the 
    right of each name in the index corresponds to a number listed 
    for that head of household on the house lists.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the house list pages, 
    these numbers typically appear to the left of the head of household name.&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
    most of these name indices, the ink is very light, and the scanned images are 
    difficult to read.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <b>1797 House List </b>- The 
  1797 house lists include all of the free people and serfs on the 
  estate.&nbsp;&nbsp;In some instances, a cover page with the census title and 
  estate name appears before the first house list page.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final 
  house list page includes a grand total (Summa) and the signature of the estate 
  owner with an official seal.&nbsp;&nbsp;(The seal appears as a large black dot 
  on the images.)&nbsp;&nbsp;These are generally readable, although some pages 
  may be light or cut off on the left or right margin.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <b>1797 Attestations</b> - The 
  1797 attestations, which typically follow the 1797 house lists, include a 
  promise that all individuals on the estate were counted.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
  attestation includes the signature and official seal of the estate owner or 
  his representative.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <b>1803 Census</b> - The 1803 
  census includes house lists for only the sefts from the 1797 
  census.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is usually a cover page before the first 1803 house 
  list page.&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, most of the 1803 house list pages are 
  faded and light.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these pages are difficult to read.
  </li>
</ul>
<HR>

<H4>Why These Documents are Difficult to Read</H4>
<P>There are many factors that make these document very difficult to read.
  <br></P>
<ul>
  <li> The records and attestations on the 1797 Courland 
  Census were written in Gothic German Script, with the exception of proper 
  names that were usually written in Latin Script.&nbsp;&nbsp;For most people 
  who read English, the Latin Script used for the names of individuals and 
  places will be much easier to read than the German Script used for notations, 
  titles, and attestations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gothic German Script can be very 
  difficult to read, even for native speakers of German.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> Some of the estate owners in the Courland Parishes were 
  Polish, so some of spellings of names on house lists were written with a 
  Polish influence.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Polish "sz" is used in place of 
  the German "sch."&nbsp;&nbsp; The name "Schmuel" might appear as "Szmuel." 
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> Even the names as recorded by the German estate 
  owners are difficult to read, as the 1797 German spellings of names are very 
  different than those used in modern-day German records.
  </li></ul>
<ul>
  <li> When the Parish Books were microfilmed in 1940, 
  several of the images were cut off on the left or right margin, so some text 
  is missing.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<ul>
  <li> The 1797 and 1803 house lists were handwritten with a 
  quill (feather) pen, as the steel pen was not invented until a few decades after these census documents 
  were created.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the quill pen often caused the writing to be sloppy 
  and blotchy.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was difficult to make clean corrections with the quill, 
  which is another factor that makes these documents difficult to read.&nbsp; 
  Also, the quality of the inks used to create these documents varied, and 
  some were prone to fading.
  </li>
</ul>
