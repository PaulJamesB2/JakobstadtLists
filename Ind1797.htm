<H3 align=left>Introduction</H3>
<DIV align=left>The Courland Census 1797 Parish Census 
documents included Jewish House Lists.&nbsp; Many of these Jews were innkeepers 
and wine distillers and lived at the inns at the 
various parish estates and small villages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Included on these web 
pages are house lists for villages and estates in the political parishes of 
Dunaburg, Nerft, Ascheraden, Selburg, and Uberlautz.&nbsp; These parishes were 
in the vicinity of the city of Jakobstadt, so most of the Jews in these House 
Lists registered in the Jakobstadt City Tax Registers in 1798.&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
this reason, many of these individuals are included in the Jakobstadt Tax 
Registers and House Lists for 1803 through 1858 that&nbsp;appear on these web 
page.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV align=left>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV align=left>Unlike the other census documents on these web pages, the 1797 
census documents are not presented in table format.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, these Jewish House Lists are translated and presented&nbsp;as they appeared in the original documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a more detailed explaination about the 1797 Courland Census&nbsp;<A href="IntroFul.htm">click here.</A></FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<H3 align=left>Name Searches</H3>
<DIV align=left>In 1797, Jews did not have hereditary last 
names that were passed down from father to son.&nbsp; Instead, many Jews used the father's name 
as a patronymic.&nbsp; For example, Abraham Hirschowitz was Abraham, son of Hirsch.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
important to understand when reviewing these pages&nbsp;that a 
patronymic in 1797 was probably <U>not</U> a family name that was 
passed down to later generations.&nbsp; (Herediatry last names started to be used in Courland a few decades later.) </DIV>
<DIV align=left>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV align=left>            
      In order to facilitate 
searching through these documents, two indices were created: </DIV>
<DIV align=left>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV align=left><STRONG><A href="IndFutur.htm">Index by Surname or Patronymic for Future Records</STRONG> </A></DIV>
<DIV align=left>There were a few dozen families on these 1797 House Lists that could 
be connected to later census records from 1803 through 1858.&nbsp; This index 
shows those families.&nbsp; They are identified by:</DIV>
<DIV align=left>--future surname, which might be patronymic</DIV>
<DIV align=left>--1797 patronymic (or first name of the father, if no patronymic)</DIV>
<DIV align=left>--1797 first and middle name</DIV>
<DIV align=left>--estate</DIV>
<DIV align=left>--inn or property on the estate</DIV>
<DIV align=left>--parish book number</DIV>
<DIV align=left>--parish name</DIV>
<DIV align=left>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV align=left>If you go to the referenced 1797 house list and click on a link by 
the name of the head of household, you will see a web page that lists future records for this family.</DIV>
