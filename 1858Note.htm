        These 1858 Tax Registers are partial 
reconstructions of lost census documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;         
           
           
         
        Several different 
documents were used to reconstruct these lost tax registers.&nbsp; Existing Jakobstadt 
Military Recruits lists for 1868 and 1871 reference&nbsp;many of 
the individuals from the 1858 Tax Registers, along with their&nbsp;1858 Tax (Oklad) 
Numbers.&nbsp; Several census documents&nbsp;from 1797 through 1871 were used to determine the family relationships.&nbsp;

  <DIV align=left> It should be noted that some of these 
  men and women may not have been married in 
  1858.&nbsp; Some of the marriages may have taken place as late 
  as 1871.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is because the marriages were mentioned in the later 
  documents.</DIV></LI></UL>

  <DIV align=left>The Military Recruits Lists used for these reconstructions 
  also referenced the 1858&nbsp;Family Numbers from the 1858 Revision 
  Lists.&nbsp; These are included in these reconstructed Tax Registers, although 
  they were not on the original documents.</DIV></LI></UL>
